# 🌍 GIS Freelancing Portfolio by Dayo Daudu

Welcome to my GIS portfolio! I'm a geospatial analyst and an individual who is passionate about applying GIS and Remote Sensing techniques to solve environmental, ecological, and land-use challenges.

This repository showcases selected projects that demonstrate my skills in:

- 🌿 Vegetation and Wetland Analysis  
- 🛰️ Land Use/Land Cover Classification  
- 📊 NDVI and Vegetation Index Computation  
- 🗺️ Drone Mapping and Spatial Data Visualization  
- 🛠️ Tools: Google Earth Engine, QGIS, ArcGIS, Python, and Remote Sensing APIs

---

## 📁 Projects Included

### 🔹 1. NDVI Analysis – Ilaje Wetlands (1998–2023)
- **Tool Used:** Google Earth Engine  
- **Data Source:** Landsat 5, 7, 8, 9  
- **Goal:** To assess vegetation health and wetland degradation over time.  
- **Output:** Time-series NDVI map, vegetation change chart.

---

### 🔹 2. LULC Classification – Ilaje, Ondo state (Land Cover Analysis)
- **Tool Used:** QGIS (Supervised Classification)  
- **Method:** Maximum Likelihood  
- **Result:** Classified map and confusion matrix  
- **Years Compared:** 1995 and 2025
